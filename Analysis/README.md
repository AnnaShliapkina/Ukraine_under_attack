# Analysis of Conflict Data in Ukraine

## Introduction

This repository contains an analysis of conflict data in Ukraine, focusing on various aspects such as event types, fatalities, regions, and temporal trends.

## Dataset

The dataset used for analysis is sourced from cleaned_data.csv. It contains information about events, including event date, type, sub-event type, actors involved, location, fatalities, and population data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Event Types

- The analysis compares different event types to identify the most dangerous ones based on the number of events and fatalities.
- Bar charts are used to visualize the frequency of events and fatalities by event type.

### Regions

- Data is analyzed by regions to understand the distribution of events and fatalities across different administrative units.
- Bar charts are plotted to show the number of events and fatalities by region.

### Temporal Trends

- The analysis examines temporal trends in events and fatalities over time, including monthly and yearly variations.
- Line plots and bar charts are utilized to visualize the trends in events and fatalities.

## Conclusion

- The analysis provides insights into the conflict dynamics in Ukraine, highlighting the most frequent event types, regions most affected by the conflict, and temporal patterns in events and fatalities.
- These insights can inform policymakers, researchers, and humanitarian organizations working in conflict-affected areas.
