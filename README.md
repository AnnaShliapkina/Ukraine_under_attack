## Project Description

This project investigates the war in Ukraine and changes in attacks and fatalities since the beginning of the war on February 24, 2022, to the present day. The data for analysis was obtained from [ACLED](https://acleddata.com), which contains information on all political violence events, demonstration events, and strategic developments in Ukraine.

## Dataset Description

_(A detailed description of the dataset, its structure, content, and potential use. This section will be completed later.)_

## Steps Taken

The following steps were taken in the project:

### 1. Data Checking

Data was checked for missing values and duplicates.

### 2. Data Cleaning

#### Data Cleaning Phase

In the data cleaning phase, the raw dataset was processed to ensure consistency and reliability. The following steps were undertaken:

- **Loading and Exploration:**

  - The dataset was loaded into the environment using Pandas, and an initial exploration was conducted to understand its structure and content.

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**

  - Irrelevant or redundant columns were removed, and missing or inconsistent values were addressed.
  - Data types were adjusted, and columns were renamed for clarity.

- **Data Filtering:**

  - The dataset was filtered to include only relevant data points based on specific criteria or conditions.

- **Data Export:**
  - The cleaned dataset was exported to a CSV file for further analysis and modeling.

For a detailed overview of the data cleaning process and the code implementation, please refer to the `cleaning.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

### 3. Data Visualization

Various graphs and visualizations were created for a better understanding of the data.

### File Structure:

- **cleaned_data.csv**: Cleaned dataset saved in CSV format.
- **cleaning.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data cleaning.

3. **Data Visualization**: Various graphs and visualizations were created for a better understanding of the data.
